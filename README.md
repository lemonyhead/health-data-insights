# Health Data Analytics: U.S. Heart Disease Mortality

This repository contains a multi-phase data analytics project focused on heart disease mortality trends in the United States. Using real-world health datasets, we explore, visualize, and model the data to uncover insights that can inform public health strategies.

## Project Structure

- `Heart_Disease_Mortality.csv`: Raw dataset from a public health source containing county-level heart disease mortality rates.
- `Final Project.ipynb`: Consolidated notebook showcasing the end-to-end analytics workflow including preprocessing, visualizations, modeling, and insights.
- `PhaseII.ipynb`: Intermediate analysis notebook focused on initial data exploration and feature engineering.
- `PhaseIII.ipynb`: Advanced analysis notebook with model development, refinement, or geographic analysis (e.g., heatmaps, clustering).

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   Explore demographic, geographic, and temporal trends in heart disease mortality.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create relevant features that may correlate with mortality rates (e.g., location, population attributes).

3. **Modeling**  
   Build predictive models to identify key drivers of heart disease mortality using techniques such as regression or classification.

4. **Visualization**  
   Communicate insights using visual tools like histograms, heatmaps, and trend plots.

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-data-analytics.git
   cd health-data-analytics
